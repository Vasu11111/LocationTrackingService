# 📍 Android Foreground Location Service

This project demonstrates how to implement a **foreground location service** in an Android app using **Kotlin**. The app continuously fetches the user's location in the background and logs it.

## 📱 Features
✅ Requests **Fine & Coarse Location** permissions at runtime  
✅ Handles **Background Location Access** (Android 10+)  
✅ Starts a **Foreground Service** with a persistent notification  
✅ Uses **FusedLocationProviderClient** for accurate location tracking  
✅ Shows a **Settings Dialog** if the user denies permissions
